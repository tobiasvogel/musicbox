# MIDI Music Box

This is an improved version of the original musicbox project by [mitxela](https://github.com/mitxela/musicbox).

There are two major enhancements over the original version:
 - PCBs (Gerber and EAGLE) for the circuits as well as most of the mechanical parts
 - A (optional) addon-board featuring a Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 providing MIDI-file support from both microSD-cards and via WiFi (Webbrowser)

In the future I will furthermore add:
 * *BOM for all PCBs* (work-in-progress)
 * Renderings for visualization
 * Detailed assembly instructions
